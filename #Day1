Time Complexity of an Algorithm
-------------------------------
Definition:  It is the amount of time taken by the algorithm to run as a function of length of input.


Why ?
1)For making better programs
2)Comparision of Algorithms



Asymptotic Notations
-----------------------
1)Big O Notation(Worst time Complexity)
2)Omega Notation(Best Time Complexity)
3)Theta Notation(Average time complexity)
